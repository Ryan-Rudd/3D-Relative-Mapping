# 3D-Relative-Mapping
 A sensor-driven system for real-time 3D mapping and positional tracking using mobile device accelerometer and gyroscopic data. This project constructs a relative coordinate matrix by integrating motion detection and orientation mapping, enabling precise localization and movement analysis in 3D space.
