# 3D-Relative-Mapping

A sophisticated computational system engineered for real-time 3D mapping and positional tracking, leveraging the inertial sensors embedded within mobile devices. This project harnesses the capabilities of accelerometers and gyroscopes, processed through the Expo framework, to dynamically compute relative positional offsets and orientations. By constructing a comprehensive transformation matrix, the system adeptly maps device motion and orientation within a localized 3D spatial framework.

## Features
- **Precision Motion Detection**: Utilizes advanced threshold-based algorithms to discern significant movements from accelerometer data, ensuring high-fidelity motion tracking.
- **Robust Orientation Tracking**: Processes gyroscopic data to accurately monitor and compute device rotational dynamics across multiple axes.
- **Dynamic 3D Spatial Mapping**: Continuously updates a sophisticated coordinate matrix to reflect the device's evolving position and orientation relative to its initial origin.
- **Integrated Sensor Fusion**: Seamlessly amalgamates data from multiple sensors to deliver unparalleled accuracy in motion and orientation determination.
- **Expo Framework Integration**: Employs the Expo platform to streamline development, deployment, and cross-platform compatibility, enhancing overall application performance and maintainability.

## How It Works
### Motion Detection
1. **Accelerometer Data Acquisition**: The accelerometer captures real-time linear acceleration data along the three principal axes (x, y, z), providing a granular view of the device’s movement.
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: The system persistently analyzes accelerometer outputs to identify fluctuations indicative of motion.
3. **Threshold Filtering**: By applying a meticulously calibrated threshold, the system effectively filters out minor perturbations, ensuring that only significant movements are processed and mapped.

### Orientation Tracking
1. **Gyroscopic Data Acquisition**: The gyroscope records angular velocity, capturing the device’s rotational movements with high precision across the three axes.
2. **Rotational Dynamics Computation**: The system interprets gyroscopic data to compute real-time changes in orientation, enabling accurate tracking of device rotation over time.
3. **Integration of Rotational Data**: By integrating the angular velocity data, the system maintains an up-to-date representation of the device’s orientation relative to its initial state.

### Sensor Fusion and Mapping
1. **Data Integration**: The system synergistically combines accelerometer and gyroscope data to form a cohesive understanding of the device’s motion and orientation within 3D space.
2. **Positional and Rotational Calculations**: Utilizing advanced algorithms, the system calculates the device’s movement and rotation from its starting position, ensuring precise localization.
3. **Transformation Matrix Construction**: These calculations feed into the creation and continual updating of a 3D transformation matrix, encapsulating the device's current position and orientation relative to the origin.

### Real-Time 3D Mapping
1. **Continuous Matrix Updates**: The transformation matrix is dynamically updated in real-time as new sensor data streams in, reflecting the device's latest positional and orientational state.
2. **Comprehensive Spatial Representation**: The matrix provides an exhaustive and accurate depiction of the device’s movement trajectory and orientation shifts within a three-dimensional space.
3. **Seamless Data Visualization**: Enables the generation of real-time visual representations of the device’s spatial dynamics, facilitating applications in various high-precision fields.
